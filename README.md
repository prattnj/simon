## What I Learned (HTML portion):

Throughout this unit, I have learned a lot more about HTML despite already knowing a decent amount. For example, I have never embedded videos in a webpage that way before. Additionally, I learned more about the various options we have for inputting information and even displaying that information, using elements like tables.

## What I Learned (CSS portion):

For years now, I have been using CSS to design websites that are more pleasing to the eye. I haven't, however, ever received any kind of formal education about any kind of HTML, CSS, or JavaScript. Before this unit, I thought I already knew most of what there was to know about CSS. On the contrary, I ended up learning quite a lot about various areas of CSS. I think the most I learned came from the section about transitions and animations. I was unaware of just how many options you have for that type of thing.

## What I Learned (JavaScript portion):

JavaScript is one of those languages I have always had a love/hate relationship with. Throughout this unit, however, I have learned about many new ways I can use JS to improve my web programming. I've learned that JavaScript is useful because it enables developers to create interactive and dynamic web pages that can respond to user input and update content in real-time. Additionally, JavaScript can be used for both front-end and back-end development, making it a versatile language for building web applications of all kinds.
