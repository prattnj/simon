## What I Learned (HTML portion):

Throughout this unit, I have learned a lot more about HTML despite already knowing a decent amount. For example, I have never embedded videos in a webpage that way before. Additionally, I learned more about the various options we have for inputting information and even displaying that information, using elements like tables.

## What I Learned (CSS portion):

For years now, I have been using CSS to design websites that are more pleasing to the eye. I haven't, however, ever received any kind of formal education about any kind of HTML, CSS, or JavaScript. Before this unit, I thought I already knew most of what there was to know about CSS. On the contrary, I ended up learning quite a lot about various areas of CSS. I think the most I learned came from the section about transitions and animations. I was unaware of just how many options you have for that type of thing.
